        <p>“Introduction of Chinese Ancient Literature” website is based on Chinese culture and literature offering to the customers around the world who are fascinated in ancient culture and want to get more detail about them.

        </p>

        <p>Chinese literature is one of the most imaginative and creative in the world by the high precision language and tonal patterns in classical Chinese poetry. [1] As time goes by, ancient people use oracle bones, wood, bamboo and silk to record the character which represent civilization of human society.

        </p>

        <p>There are various literature works which spanning 5000 years, including classical texts, classical poetry, classical prose, classical fiction, classical drama and etc. In our website, there are several representative types of ancient literature including some famous poem, writers and the basic background history.

        </p>

        <p>Unlike other literature websites, which are only provide single literary appreciation without social situation, author’s experience and the changes in the national situation. Our website will combine all the related experience to help visitors understand the literary meaning. Besides, our website will provide suggestions about the masterpiece. What is more, we will enrich user experience providing audio, image and video.

        </p>

        <p>I am an ANU international student who are from China and have rich ancient Chinese literature base. As an international student who have passion in cultural transmission, and make some contributions in cultural integration between China and English-speaking country, I made this website as a start.

        </p>

        <p>As an ancient famous poem Qu Yuan said, “The journey is long, but I’ll search up and down”, I will use this whole semester to build this website as perfect as possible.
